# Happiness Garden

## Technologies

- **Kotlin**
- **Firebase**

## Description
Happiness Garden is a wellness app that gamifies the habit of self-reflection and gratitude. Each journal entry will add a new flower to a personalized garden, creating a visual representation of the userâ€™s reflections over time. Users are prompted to write down what they are grateful for and any worries they may have, allowing for a balanced and mindful habit. The app is built in Kotlin and uses Firebase to manage user data and backend functionality.

## Features
- **User login**: Users can securely log in to access and revisit their garden.
- **Add new entries**: Each entry, consisting of reflections on gratitude and concerns, grows a new flower in their plot.
- **Multiple plots**: After filling a plot with 15 flowers, users can navigate to new plots and continue adding flowers
- **Edit entries**: Users can update previous entries to reflect changes or add further thoughts.

## Background
Created from 10.23.2024 to 10.30.2024. A week ago I found myself with a bit of free time and a curiosity to learn Kotlin. After watching introductory Kotlin YouTube videos, I decided to try working with the language myself by creating a personal app that I have been wanting to make for a while. I found that regularly reflecting on daily gratitudes and worries has always helped me feel happier and more relaxed. Inspired by this, I wanted to design an interactive tool that could make this practice more enjoyable, adding a touch of gamification to a habit that I personally try to do consistently as well.

## Future Ideas
- **Expanded entry input**: Allow users to rate their happiness and stress levels each day. They will be represented on the info card with the sun and rain emojis.
- **Calendar integration**: Display entries on a calendar, marking the date with flowers for each journal entry added.
- **Groq API integration**: Using an AI API, summarize users' weekly or monthly entries, offering insights and reminders on practices that previously brought joy.
